# Tuning the metrics of fuzzy kNN classifier for the medical diagnosis of diabetes
This project proposes a novel approach for enhancing the accuracy and robustness of the fuzzy kNN classifier in diabetes diagnosis through the integration of uncertainty membership measures. We aim to fine-tune the fuzzy kNN classifier by incorporating uncertainty-based membership values for each data point, providing a more refined and contextually relevant distance metric during classification.
# Key Technical Highlights
Algorithm Used: Fuzzy KNN with uncertainty-based membership modeling.

Improvement Goal: Increase diagnostic accuracy & robustness under noisy or uncertain conditions.

Method: Assign uncertainty-aware fuzzy membership values instead of fixed ones, influencing distance computation.

Dataset Example: Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (Kaggle).

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, Sensitivity (Recall), Specificity.

Expected Outcome: More reliable classification for borderline or ambiguous samples.
